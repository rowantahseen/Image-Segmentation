# Image-Segmentation
Image Segmentation using Berkeley's  Segmentation Benchmark 
https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/

1) visualizing the images and ground truthes
2) Preprocessing on the image (resizing, blurr)
3) using K-Means on the RGB values of the image with different numbers of clusters
4) Calculate the F-measure and Conditional Entropy (implementation from contagiousy matrix)
5) Spectrul Clustering 
6) Adding more features not only the RGB but also the pixle positon of x and y  Features = (X,Y,R,G,B)
